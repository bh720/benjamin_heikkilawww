<h1>KH 15D</h1>
<p>KH 15D (V582 Monocerotis), described as a winking star because of its unusual dips in brightness,[11] is a binary T Tauri star system embedded in a circumbinary disk.</p>
<p>It is a member of the young open cluster NGC 2264, located about 2,500 light-years (770 pc) from the Sun in the constellation of Monoceros.</p>
<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>he unique brightness variations of KH 15D were discovered at Wesleyan University's Van Vleck Observatory in 1995 by Dr. William Herbst and his then-master's student Kristin Kearns.[12] The star was found to alternate, on a 48.37-day period[3] between a brighter "on" state and a fainter "off" state that was less than 4% of the bright state (or up to 96% dimmed). As the years went by, the star spent more and more time "off", such that by 2010 it was always in the faint state, although still periodically variable. In 2012 it unexpectedly began to "wink" on and off again and has now entered a phase where its "on" state is almost twice as bright as it was in the mid-1990's (see light curve).</p>
