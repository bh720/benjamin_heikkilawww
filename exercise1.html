<h1>Baby boom for Helsinki's city bunnies</h1>
<p>While exact numbers remain unclear, an expert estimates there are thousands of rabbits across the city.</p>

<h2>Eastward bound bunnies</h2>
<p>The inspector said he was unsure of exactly how many rabbits there are, as no attempt has ever been made to count them. In any case, he said there are thousands of the feral animals in Helsinki alone. "More than five years ago the rabbits were often seen in the Kallio district and near the Opera House [in the Töölö district], but now they're not as visible in central parts of the city," Pakarinen said, noting the rabbits have moved to areas like Herttoniemi and Vuosaari, in eastern Helsinki.</p>
<h2>Mild winter means more rabbits</h2>
<p>If this year's warm winter weather continues, the rabbit population could even expand further.</p>
